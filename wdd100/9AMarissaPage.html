    <h1>Unique Handmade Jewelry</h1>

            <h3>Process</h3>

            <p>The first step of any project is figuring out what your message will be. This is vital because it helps lay the foundation and give you a starting point. Then, after making some sketches, I started creating it in Adobe Illustrator. I tried many different variations to discover what the best design would be for this company.</p>

            <h3>Color Scheme</h3>

            <p>Once I had the black and white versions, it was time to think color. The color scheme I picked is monochromatic green because I wanted the logo to feel fresh, relaxing, and harmonious. I wanted my audience to look at it and see the balance that the color green creates.</p>

            <h3>My Audience</h3>

            <p>This particular company, Wired Dragon Jewelry, targets those who would like to buy unique jewelry. This primarily includes women, but may include husbands and fathers. In order to appeal to this audience, I made the logo unique and friendly, but also simple and memorable. </p>

            <h3>Design Skills</h3>

            <p>The little dragon was made with the pen tool in Adobe Illustrator, and was designed to draw in the viewer. The logo incoporates asymmetry in a way that makes the logo still seem balanced without being symmetrical. After trying many many different fonts, I settled for a simple sans-serif font because it was the same thickness throughout each letter and emphasized the dragon.</p>
